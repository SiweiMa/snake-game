# Drunk Snake
*a simple snake game in python to practice object-oriented-programming. But this snake is drunk, confused, and sometimes hallucinated :(*

# How it looks

After running the main file, you will see the menu with three difficulties: *slow reaction*, *confusion* and *I'm fineeeeee*.

In *slow reaction* level, the snake's reaction is always five steps slower. You can modify `delay_countdown` in `game_level1.py` to change the reaction speed. To me, the snake game becomes a shooting game.

In *confusion* level, all snake's response is opposite. The snake will go down when letting him go up.

In *I'm fineeeeee* level, the snake sees hallucinations. There are five apples (or called snacks) in his eye but only one is real.
